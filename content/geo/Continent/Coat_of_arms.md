Cities, States and Countries often feature Flags and Coats of Arms to symbolize them pictographically. 

Unless otherwise indicated, we use [File-Format~SVG](File-Format~SVG) images from the [WikiMedia](WikiMedia) Commons Collections which are typically released freely to the public. 
The naming is largely consistent: Flag_of_* and Coat_of_arms_of_*
The same holds for Flags.
